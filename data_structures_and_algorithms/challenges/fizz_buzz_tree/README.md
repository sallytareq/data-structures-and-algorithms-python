# Fizz Buzz Tree

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge Description

**Code Challenge 18:**

Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument and determines whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both.

Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used an approach similar to that of the preOrder traversal.
